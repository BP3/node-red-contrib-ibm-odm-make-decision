  <h3>Details</h3>
  <h4>Setting up the request</h4>
  <p>The request comprises of the decision service input message and any additional service configuration that is required.</p>
  <p>The request message should be in the JavaScript object format as set onto the <code>msg.payload</code> attribute.</p>
  <p>If you want to dynamically set the properties of the node rather than using the node properties editor, then you
   can do this via the <code>msg.odm</code> attribute. You can of course mix and match between setting some dynamically
   and some via the node properties editor. The available configuration properties are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.decisionId</code>: The decision Id to pass to the service that will be returned back.
       Useful for tracking transaction Id&quot;s through the system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.protocolHost</code>: This is the HTTP protocol and the host,
       for example <code>http://localhost</code> or <code>https://myodm.bpm.ibmcloud.com</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.port</code>: This is the port (which can be blank),
       for example <code>9080</code> or <code>9443</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.baseEndPointURL</code>: This is the endpoint base URL upto the rule app name
       (but after the protocol and host) which forms the start of the ruleset path.
        For example <code>odm/dev/DecisionService/rest/v1</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.ruleappName</code>: The name of the rule app to be executed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.ruleappVersion</code>: The version of rule app to be executed.
       If left empty then the latest version of the rule app will be executed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.rulesetName</code>: The name of the rule set to be executed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.rulesetVersion</code>: The version of rule set to be executed.
       If left empty then the latest version of the rule set will be executed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.useBasicAuthentication</code>:
       If set to <code>true</code> then the decision service call will attempt to authenticate using Basic Authentication.
        If set to <code>false</code> then no authentication will be performed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.authUser</code>: The user used in the basic authentication authorisation process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.authPassword</code>: The password used in the basic authentication authorisation process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.config.includeTrace</code>: If set to <code>true</code> then (a subset of) trace information will
       be returned back in the response (see section below for more details).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Successful response</h4>
  <p>
    If the request was successful then the <code>msg.payload</code> attribute will contain the raw decision service
    response. The <code>msg.odm</code> attribute will also contain additional information about the service call
    including trace information if that was requested. This will also be present in the <code>msg.payload</code> but
    it is parsed and made more readily available in this object to save you from having to extract and parse it. The
    trace information returned just contains the most commonly requested useful items and there is no current way of
     defining the trace filters individually. The items returned are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.requestedUrl</code>: The full decision service URL requested.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.requestBody</code>: The contents of the <code>msg.payload</code> sent in the request.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.decisionId</code>: The decision Id sent in the request, or a generated one from the Decision Server.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.requestedRulesetPath</code>: The rule set path requested in the decision service URL,
       for example <code>/MyRuleApp/MyRuleSet</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.requestedRulesetPath</code>: The actual rule set path that was executed,
       for example <code>/MyRuleApp/1.0/MyRuleSet/2.0</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.executionDate</code>: The time stamp of when the decision service was executed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.executionDuration</code>: The time in milli-seconds it took for the decision service to execute.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.rulesFired</code>: A list of the rules that fired (business rule names only).
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.hasErrored</code>: Indicates if the service execution has failed for any reason or not.
       For successful calls this will be <code>false</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.serviceStatusCode</code>: This will contain the HTTP status code.
       For successful calls this will be <code>200</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Failures</h4>
  <p>
    Failures can manifest themselves in several ways. First, the request could be sent to Decision Server but the format
    of the request is incorrect, or the rule set path does not exist. Other types of errors could be HTTP transport type
    errors, such as the server being unavailable. The raw failure/error messages will set in the
    <code>msg.payload</code> attribute. In addition, an error indicator and HTTP status code (if available) will be set
    in the <code>msg.odm</code> attribute as detailed below to make it easier to interpret handle further in the flows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.hasErrored</code>: Indicates if the service execution has failed for any reason or not.
       For failed calls this will be <code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>msg.odm.serviceStatusCode</code>: This will contain the HTTP status code.
      For failed calls this might be set if the request made it to the target Decision Server,
      or for local failures it will not.
    </li>
  </ul>
